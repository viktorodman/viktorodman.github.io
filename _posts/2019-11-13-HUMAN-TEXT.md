# What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

Humans.txt is used to present information about the people that created the website and other information that can be interesting involving the website.

There is no standard on how you should write the humans.txt. 

I looked at [humanstxt.org/humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/humans.txt) and created my humans.txt based on that.
